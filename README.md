# Build A Web App: Node Edition 

## Summary 
The purpose of this workshop is to build a working backend web application with NodeJS, and no external dependencies.  We will be implement a todo list application via a RESTful API and basic filesystem operations.  

## Running The Application

1. Clone this repository to your local machine 
2. Navigate your terminal/shell to this directory 
3. From your shell, `node server.js <PORT Number>`. You are free to specify your port number. Should you not specify, it will default to 3000. You should see a message in your terminal indicating the server is listening on the specified port.
